The Powder Toy (Subframe Chipmaker Mod) - August 2016

This is a mod of The Powder Toy for subframe chipmakers. Subframe technology refers to electronic components that depend on the order in which particles are evaluated in a single frame. This mod adds the following features:

- Shift-F5 reloads the particle order.
- Shift-Space runs the simulation particle-by-particle rather than frame-by-frame.
- Shift-R starts a recording of the particle-by-particle simulation and automatically stops recording at the end of the frame. Recording can still be stopped with R but particle-by-particle simulation will still continue.
- Alt-F skips over a number of particle updates deemed "uninteresting", and does not display any log messages.

Note that all these have to be enabled with the Lua command "tpt.setdebug(0x8)". You can put that in autorun.lua.
