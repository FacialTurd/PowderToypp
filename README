The Powder Toy (Subframe Chipmaker Mod) - August 2016

This is a mod of The Powder Toy for subframe chipmakers. Subframe technology refers to electronic components that depend on the order in which particles are evaluated in a single frame.

Features
=======

These features are enabled when you enter the Lua command "tpt.setdebug(0x8)" into the console (or you can put it in autorun.lua):

- Particle order reloading: if you use the brush, then advance the simulation, the frame will be completed and the particle order will be reloaded automatically. You can reload the particle order manually with Shift-F5.
- Shift-Space runs the simulation particle-by-particle rather than frame-by-frame.
- Shift-R starts a recording of the particle-by-particle simulation and automatically stops recording at the end of the frame. Recording can still be stopped with R but particle-by-particle simulation will still continue.
- Alt-F continues updating particles until it encouters an "interesting" update (create_part, delete_part or part_change_type called), and does not display any log messages until the frame is completed.

These features will be present without enabling:

- Celsius temp: The property tool sets temp values in celsius rather than kelvin.
- Show FILT ctype: The ctype of FILTs will be displayed in the debug HUD. In the original game, this was only shown for non-FILT coloured particles like BRAY.
- 30th bit handling: Setting the ctype of coloured particles (e.g. FILT) with the property tool will XOR the input value with 0x20000000 first (so it will set the 30th bit automatically, unless you set it). When hovering the mouse over coloured particles, the ctype displayed in the debug HUD will ignore the 30th bit and, if the 29th bit is set, be displayed as a negative number.
- Starting the executable with the command line option "open <save name>" will automatically convert the save filepath to "Saves/<save name>.cps" so you don't have to retype the save name when you overwrite the file.

Note that the original game already supports the following subframe debugging features:

- Shift-F updates all particles up to the particle where your mouse is at.
- Alt-F updates a single particle. This behaviour has been modified in this mod to continue updating particles until an "interesting" update occurs.
