The Powder Toy (Subframe Chipmaker Mod) - August 2016

This is a mod of The Powder Toy for subframe chipmakers. Subframe technology refers to electronic components that depend on the order in which particles are evaluated in a single frame. This mod adds the following features:

- Particle order reloading: if you use the brush, then advance the simulation, the frame will be completed and the particle order will be reloaded automatically. You can reload the particle order manually with Shift-F5.
- Shift-Space runs the simulation particle-by-particle rather than frame-by-frame.
- Shift-R starts a recording of the particle-by-particle simulation and automatically stops recording at the end of the frame. Recording can still be stopped with R but particle-by-particle simulation will still continue.
- Alt-F only stops at particle updates deemed "interesting" (create_part, delete_part or part_change_type called), and does not display any log messages until the frame is completed.

Note that none of these features would be enabled unless you enter the Lua command "tpt.setdebug(0x8)" into the console. You can put that in autorun.lua.
