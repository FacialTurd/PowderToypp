The Powder Toy (Subframe Chipmaker Mod) - August 2016

This is a mod of The Powder Toy for subframe chipmakers. Subframe technology refers to electronic components that depend on the order in which particles are evaluated in a single frame. This mod adds the following features:

**Note that none of these features would be enabled unless you enter the Lua command "tpt.setdebug(0x8)" into the console. You can put that in autorun.lua.**

- Particle order reloading: if you use the brush, then advance the simulation, the frame will be completed and the particle order will be reloaded automatically. You can reload the particle order manually with Shift-F5.
- Shift-Space runs the simulation particle-by-particle rather than frame-by-frame.
- Shift-R starts a recording of the particle-by-particle simulation and automatically stops recording at the end of the frame. Recording can still be stopped with R but particle-by-particle simulation will still continue.
- Alt-F continues updating particles until it encouters an "interesting" update (create_part, delete_part or part_change_type called), and does not display any log messages until the frame is completed.

Note that the original game already supports the following subframe debugging features:

- Shift-F updates all particles up to the particle where your mouse is at.
- Alt-F updates a single particle. This behaviour has been modified in this mod to continue updating particles until an "interesting" update occurs.
